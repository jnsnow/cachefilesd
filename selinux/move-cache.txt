	     RELOCATING THE CACHE WITH SELINUX ENFORCEMENT ENABLED
	     =====================================================

If the cache is being used on a system on which SELinux is active and running
in enforcing mode, then the security policy installed by the cachefilesd RPM
needs to be updated to permit the CacheFiles module and daemon to access the
cache if the cache is moved.

The simplest way to do this is to add an auxiliary policy to mark out the
location of the new cache, whilst leaving the old location still available for
caching.  If anything more is required, then it will be necessary to modify the
policy that is installed.

The sources for the installed policy will be themselves installed by the
cachefilesd-selinux RPM in:

	/usr/share/doc/cachefilesd-selinux-*/

See the files named:

	cachefilesd.te
	cachefilesd.fc
	cachefilesd.if


==========================
ADDING AN AUXILIARY POLICY
==========================

Creating and adding an auxiliary policy is very easy.  Follow the following
steps:

 (0) Check that checkpolicy and selinux-policy* packages are installed.  These
     are needed to build your policy.

 (1) Create a new directory and go into it.

 (2) Create a source file to reference the security ID already set up for files
     in the cache as you'll need these to label your own cache directory.
     Assuming you're going to name your policy "mycache", this would have to be
     called "mycache.te":

	[mycache.te]
	policy_module(mycache,1.0.0)
	require { type cachefiles_var_t; }

 (3) Create a source file to note the directory in which you wish your cache to
     reside.  This file should be named for your policy, plus a ".fc" suffix:

	[mycache.fc]
	/mycache(/.*)? gen_context(system_u:object_r:cachefiles_var_t,s0)

     This specifies the security ID for the directory in which your cache will
     live and all its descendents.  Replace "/mycache" with the path to your
     cache's directory.

 (4) Build the policy:

	make -f /usr/share/selinux/devel/Makefile

 (5) And install it:

	semodule -i mycache.pp

 (6) Create your directory and tell SELinux to label it appropriately:

	mkdir /mycache
	restorecon /mycache

 (7) Check that the directory is labelled appropriately:

	ls -dZ /mycache

 (8) Modify /etc/cachefilesd.conf to point to the correct directory and then
     start the cachefilesd service.


The auxiliary policy can be later removed by:

	semodule -r mycache.pp

If the policy is updated, then the version number in policy_module() in
mycache.te should be increased and the module upgraded:

	semodule -u mycache.pp
